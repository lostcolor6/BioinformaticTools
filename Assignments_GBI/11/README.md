### 1. Identification of RNA Secondary Structure Elements (1P)

In the lecture you have learned about RNA secondary structure elements. Consider the following schematic of a RNA secondary structure; Highlight and name four different secondary structure elements in the image.

### 2. Visualization of RNA Secondary Structures (2P)

For the following two RNA sequences, their respective secondary structure representation is provided in (extended) dot-bracket format. You are asked to draw their secondary structure as a `graph` (cf. the image from task one) and in the `arc representation`.

**(a) Hairpin Structure**

```
CACGCUGAACGUACU
.(((.....)))...
```

**(b) Pseudoknot Structure**

### 3. Nussinov Algorithm - By Hand (8.5P)

**(a)** The pseudo code for the traceback of the Nussinov algorithm - as presented in the lecture - does not return the actual RNA secondary structure, e.g. in the form of the dot bracket notation. You are asked to modify the Nussinov folding algorithm so that the traceback reconstructs a valid dot-bracket notation for secondary structures. Hand in the extended pseudo code of the traceback.

(b) For the sequence `AGAGUCCACUGA` compute the secondary structure using the original Nussinov algorithm. Please hand-in the DP matrix, highlight the traceback which contains a bifurcation and provide that solution in its dot-bracket notation.

### 4. Quality of protein secondary structure prediction (6P)
Imagine you were asked to test the quality of an algorithm predicting the secondary structure of proteins.
$H$= helix, $E$= beta strands, $C$= coils or loops.


You assembled the overall misclassification errors of $H$, $E$ and $C$ states where H $\leftrightarrow$ E shows the misclassification between helix and beta strand, H $\leftrightarrow$ C shows the misclassification between helix and coil, and E $\leftrightarrow$ C shows the misclassification between beta strand and coil. You also determined the misclassification errors of the boundary regions of the respective secondary structure elements (H/E/C (boundary)).
The $Q_3$ (internal) and $Q_3$ (boundary) shows the prediction accuracy for internal and boundary regions of secondary structure elements. Your findings are summarized in the following table: 

|     | Method (%) |
|-----|---------|
H $\leftrightarrow$ E  |	0.96 |
H $\leftrightarrow$ C	| 9.5	|
E $\leftrightarrow$ C  | 7.6 |
H/E/C (boundary)|	37.9/38.3/24.3  |
$Q_3$ (internal)|	87.9  |
$Q_3$ (boundary)| 68.6  |

**(a)** Can you find an explanation why the misclassification error between H $\leftrightarrow$ E  is lower than for H $\leftrightarrow$ C and E $\leftrightarrow$ C? (Max. 50 words)

### Answer

````
maybe because helices (H) and beta strands (E) might have more distinct and regular hydrogen
bonding patterns and (backbone) dihedral angles compared to coils (C) (which are more irregular and variable).
````

**(b)** Looking at the classification errors of the boundary regions for secondary structure elements. Discuss briefly possible reasons for the varying errors. (Max. 50 words)

### Answer

````
classification errors in the boundary regions might be higher because these regions are,
 where one structure changes into another, making them less clear and more likely to be confused with each other.
(secondary structure elements are less well-defined and exhibit features of both adjacent structures
->increased ambiguity and misclassification)
````

**(c)** Can you think of an explanation for the higher accuracy of predictions for the internal regions compared to boundary regions? (Max. 50 words)

### Answer

````
internal regions have more consistent and clear patterns, making them easier to predict correctly.
Boundary regions, being in transition between different structures, are less clear and harder to predict accurately.
````
